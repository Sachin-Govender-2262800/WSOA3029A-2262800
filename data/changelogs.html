      <p>Since the website was updated, I have added 1 other graph this one being an interactive graph. 
          I have also added a few more images and links as well as the creation of this page. The footer has also increased in height as the thin footer was not as 
          appealing. The size of some of the words in the navbar was also increased. With the blogs, the spacing was decreased and the words were moved to the left 
          rather than starting at the centre as it made it harder to read when it was like that. I have also made this page as well as the pages dedicated towards the Dota2 Data.
          There have also been the addition of blogs those that were required to be met.
