      <section class = "paragraph1"><p style = "font-size: 18px">The website is designed around provided the visitors with data around specfic video games, mainly competitive games.
    Such as CS:GO, League of Legends, Dota 2, Overwatch and many other Esports games. The original idea for the website was to create a website that would compare and visualise
data from diffrent Esports games. Unfortunately there is no real Api that allows for that information and those that do are extremely hard to work with and use. So instead the website follows 
data from the players that play the games, as of writing this those games are League of Legends and Legends of Runeterra with hopefully more.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p style = "font-size: 18px">The website is designed to be simple, using a simple layout while maintaining a visually appealing look, nothing that overwhelms the visitors or bores them as the colors follow a blue, white and black color Scheme.
    The specfic color scheme is displayed in the color scheme page of the Desgins page. This was done as blue is a very calming color, a very analytical color. Yet is used allot in many games
such as League and most gamers may have headphones, mouse or keyboards that are blue. So the idea was to follow that gaming feel. Having it follow such a calming and analytical color scheme and mood
was to allow visitors to read through the data and blogs and understand and gauge with the information. The information displayed is in no way provocative meaning bright
or vibrant colors would not be needed, while the colors that are used pop enough to keep the visitor intrested in the website. For the graph displaying League data, the reason for the use of metallic gold was done because that is a 
common color used in League of Legends, especially seen within its logo.  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The home page displays 3 images that being of 3 diffrent games, 2 of those games are already used in the data visualisation. The third being Dota 2 is something that is still in the process
            of being worked with in a way that is hopefully more unique to the other 2 data visual styles. Speaking of the visuals The reasons that each was choosen comes into mind. The reason for the bar graph for the 
            specfic data being dispalyed that being the comparisson of a higher level of players and lower level of players was done as to show the major diffrence in skill expression especially in terms of wins and how much skill it might take to get to that point. Admittedly that data could
            have been better expressed through a Diverging Bar chart or Stacked Bar chart which could have been used to express more details like the players wins and losses, this however was not done as of writting this as 
            trying to get the api and actually picking the specfic topic and narrative I wanted was extremely hard. This was Due to family issues, University and the biggest fact being that All the topics I wanted to do weather it was Esports, Animal tracking or music where either extremly hard to work with
            or did not provide the appropriate information. The Scatter Plot graph was done for the Legends of Runeterra data as it was a better way to show the data, a line grap Overall I had decided to go for a simple website one that wouldn't overwhelm
            the visitor and be one that lets the data and other players speak for themselves.</p>
