      <article class = "paragraph1"><p>Data visualisation may appear to be an obscure term however many of have used some form of Data visualisation
           in one form or another. This blog post will be reflecting on the 2020 reading by Qi Li known as ‘Overview of Data Visualization’. The major 
           point of discussion is Data visualization what it is, why it is used and how data is represented and visualised. However, to first understand Data 
           visualisation one must understand what exactly data is.</p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>According to the reading data usually refers to unprocessed or raw information and can be organised in a variety of forms such as names, age, 
               numbers, signs, symbols or characters. There are two forms of data that being primary and secondary data, primary data is data that is collected 
               directly from an individual or unit such as interviews. Secondary data as defined by Agarwal can be seen as the information that can be gathered 
               from the data. Information can be defined as the collection of data or data that processed into something useful. With this knowledge Data visualization
                can be more easily defined, Data visualisation is defined as the connection between data and computer technology and how data is transformed into a sonic
                 or visual form. This data is then presented with the aim to provide the users with an intuitive means to interact, explore and analyse data. Data visualization 
                 involved four aspects these being real-time interactions, on the fly processing, visual scalability and user assistance and personalization, 
                 this information can then be categorized into two major sub-fields that being information visualization and scientific visualization. Information 
                 visualisation can be seen visually representing abstract data whereas scientific visualisation is seen represented more scientific data. When representing 
                 data the goal of data visualisation aims to create an understandable information that can be used to gain insight and knowledge to those who view the data, 
                 as these visual data will then be interpreted through the human cognition system.</p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>The reading then defines Traditional data visualization with the idea that different forms of data visualization presents a different visual effect which can then be 
               used to help identify a problem or issue. Information visualization as well as scientific visualization are different research fields however the way data is
                represented by these two fields can be seen as very similar. The most common forms of data visualisation are Tables, lists, Charts, Trees, Maps, Diagrams. 
                Graphs, Waveforms, Volume, Simulation and Scatter-Plots.  To create good Data visualisation one needs to understand the common characterises of traditional 
                Data visualisation. Important characteristics of traditional Data visualisation according to the reading is seen having data that has readability, is
                 recognisable and has meaning, there are other characteristics such as graphical design, colour  and interactivity  however, the previous three characteristics
                  can be seen and the most essential. These are essential as they are based on the comprehension and knowledge acquisition that can be gathered from Data 
                  Visualisation. Data visualisation requires high skills in storing, managing and analysing huge data flow, however this data needs to also visually represent
                   the data effectively in order to allow for proper communication. Something that can greatly effect Data visualisation is the Human Perception as it can
                    remarkably improve both the quality and quantity of the information that can be gathered to be displayed.  Perception being defined as the way that sensory 
                    data is organized, experienced and interpreted by a person clearly linking it to a person’s senses. Psychological researchers, scholars and study have looked 
                    and analysed how the human system perceives and analyses images, one of the key findings that could be found from the study is a term known as preattentive 
                    which is related to attention. Healey investigates four theories of preattentive processing this being texton theory, integration theory, similar theory and 
                    guided search theory. </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>The reading ‘Overview of Data Visualization’ by Qi Li explains how Data visualisation is used to order information and convert it to comprehensible
                information to any viewer that may be interested in a specified topic. The reading went on to explain what Data visualisation is, how the end resulting 
                data is displayed as well as factors that can assists in creating Data visualisation that is appropriate and will be the most likely to succeed.</p>
