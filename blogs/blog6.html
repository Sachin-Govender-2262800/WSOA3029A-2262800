           <p>Today’s blog will analyse a chosen case study from Information is Beautiful in terms of the representation and communication strategies that are used.
              The case study I will be using from Information is Beautiful is known as “Best in Show – What’s the Best Dog Breed, According to Data?” (Quick et al., n.d.).</p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p> Before analysing the way information is represented one needs to understand at what bases the example will be analysed with. In accordance to data by Nuckols (2020) Visual communication faces 3 core issues this being Limited attention, 
             Difficulties for the visitor to remember your content and a failure to understand what is being said. Instead of using a bar or line graph the information is displayed as a 
             scatterplot or a bubble chart where the points are displayed using labelled silhouetted diagrams of the dogs themselves. The chart overwhelms the visitor with text, the breed 
             of dog is labelled using specific colours such as orange representing herding dogs and purple being used for hound dogs. The dog’s intelligence is represented by the direction
              that the dog is facing left being considered as dumb whereas facing right is a clever dog. The purpose of these visuals are used in a representational manner as the visuals
               physically represent and physically resemble the objects and are relevant to the content of the text, it can also been seen as organisational as the placements of the different
                dogs within the 4 charts creates structure to the information that is being viewed (Dingwall et al., n.d.)</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>In terms of the core issues that visual communication faces difficulties remembering and a failure to understand you data, it took me as well as other individuals more
              than 30 seconds to grasp what information was being portrayed as well as how the information was actively being portrayed however once the initial confusion is over the 
              data can be understood, however remembering the content becomes an issue. In terms of keeping a visitors attention the graph succeeds in that regard as a visitor 
              interested in dogs would spend more time looking at the different dog breeds position in the chart. According to why visual communication is used the chart has as 
              follows. It does not save space as often the dogs are overlapping, the representations are vivid and concrete but it is not quick, it does not speak in a universal 
              language as text is still needed to understand the visuals and it is an accurate link between raw data and the usable knowledge (Dingwall et al., n.d.). In terms of 
              text the information provided to understand the chart is easy to understand and is precise and quick to gauge, however the text within the chart is overwhelming and 
              in some cases requires allot more effort than what should be necessary to gauge what is being portrayed. </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>The data that is portrayed in the infographic is an example as to what can only be described as an adequate representation of data. It will keep the attention of its target 
                audience that being people who are fond of dogs however the information is hard to read and is overwhelming 
                even for users who have an interest in the information being portrayed. </p>
