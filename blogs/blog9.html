            One of the topics that interested me when deciding on my final idea for my website was to discuss and represent the movement of animals. Animals have always held a 
            strong place in my heart and I wanted to be able to display this with the data I produced. However nothing I would have made could come close to the data driven
             art created by Mikami Yoshiyuki known as ‘World Wildlife Foundation’s Endangered Species Pixelated Art’. This essay will be discussing just that.
            </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>
            First lets understand what exactly data driven art is. Data driven art can be seen as a process of art that requires the usage of a dataset in order to create meaning
             to an audience. This form of art is based on data and can be seen containing an objective truth behind its creation and is not created solely from the artists
              imagination (Benzi, 2020). The art that will be discussed is known as the ‘World Wildlife Foundation’s Endangered Species Pixelated Art’. In 2008 Japanese designer 
              Mikami Yoshiyuki had teamed up with the World Wildlife Foundation to create an illustration of different endangered animals (Pixelation to Represent Endangered Species
               Counts, 2019). The visual uses the data of the animal species population and represents the pixels of the image of that animal based with the amount of animals
                there are. Meaning a clear image contains animals that are doing well where as a blurrier or harder to make image contains fewer pixels based on the data of
                 how many animals within a specific species are left. Images that can be viewed from <a href = "https://mymodernmet.com/endangered-species-pixelated-photos-jjsmooth44/">https://mymodernmet.com/endangered-species-pixelated-photos-jjsmooth44/</a> it can
                  be seen that the Bengal Tiger and Asian Elephant may be blurry but can still be distinguished as the animal they are whereas the Indochinese Tiger and Black 
                  Footed Ferret are nearly impossible to make out.
             </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>This form of data driven art can be analysed in terms of artistic strategies. Mikami has a solid concept to his art, the information provided carries emotional weight and 
             it is easy for the viewer to understand and comprehend the meaning of the works. There is also text alongside all the artworks informing the user of how many animals
              within that species are left as well as what the animal is, with this information the user will easily understand what animal is being displayed and why the animal 
              is either so clear or pixelated. This can all create an emotional weight when the viewer looks at the work as they have a clearer understanding of just how few 
              animals are left. We can understand that the supporting writing works alongside the artwork in order to create meaning.</p>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <p>Data driven art is something that can be used to express information in a creative way one that attracts not only an audience interested in the topic but can 
                     interest and maintain the attention of those who normally may not have been interested in the data being expressed. Mikami is able to do just that while ensuring 
                     that the viewer understand the meaning that he wants to express while leaving the viewer with the information long before they leave the website or stop viewing 
                     the image.
