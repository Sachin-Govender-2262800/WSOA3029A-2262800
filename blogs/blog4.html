      <article class = "paragraph1"><p>With the recent situation we are all currently facing COVID truly does feel like the end of the world however throughout history there 
        has been much worse plagues and viruses that have effected human history some of which are still around today. 
        This is blog post will be analysing the historic data visualisation of the different plagues and virus throughout history.</p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>One of the most interesting infographics that I found dedicated to this topic was from research from LePan (2020), they display the amount of deaths caused by the different virus on a timeline 
             one from the earliest to present timeline and one that displays the total number of deaths, depending on the deaths determines the size of the icon representing each plague
              or virus. It has some of the most deadly linking from the least deadliest being SARS with 770 deaths from 2002 to 2003 to the Bubonic Plague with over 200 million deaths
               from 1347 to 1351. Another way of portraying this information was on horizontal bar graphs which display the information of death toll as a percent of the population with 
               COVID having some of the lowest number of 0.05% from a population of 7.9B however it can be noted previous pandemics had a lower population score. </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>Something that can be noticed from this site as told from Kidd’s reading of Representation CH1 Theories of Representation this website portrays its information 
             with more visually complex and interesting infographics rather than the kinds of infographics used in the past. This is done due the fact that the information that
              is spread needs to be instantaneously understood and be simple enough that anyone who views the data is able to understand what exactly is being represented this 
              type of graphical elements of data visualisation is thus known as ‘graphical primitives’.  One of these infographics can be portrayed by the website, is how it 
              tracks the different forms of infectiousness of different pandemics displaying this information as a bunch of heads, this is done to highlight just how easy or
               hard it actually is to infect other people, it portrays measles as being the most infectious with 16.0 and MERS being the lowest with 0.8, whereas COVID is
                displayed with a 2.5 rating. This website also allows for other users to make use of the different data visualisations on their website with a simple click
                 of a button </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>The main goal of this website is too inform the viewer of the different pandemics through human history in a way that is both modern and easy to comprehend, 
             which is achieved. One of the main points that can be gathered is that even though in current times even with COVID things could have been much worse but by
              maintaining the proper safety protocols we can in fact prevent COVID from reaching even higher numbers and in terms of this websites infographics we can prevent 
              COVID from growing in size.</p>
