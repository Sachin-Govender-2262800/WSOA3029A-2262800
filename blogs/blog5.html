      <article class = "paragraph1"><p>Most information displayed by Knaflic’s reading have been gathered around how data should be visualized, however today blog is will be based around a different topic. 
        This blog will be focusing on the several model visuals and will be discussing the thought process that leads to the creation of the different data visualizations. </p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>The first example of data visualisation comes in the form of a line graph, the graph is fully labelled. The example is designed to show the reader how important clear 
             and specific text can be used to inform the viewer of the information displayed without the need for any guide or legend to decipher the information rather the 
             information can be viewed and understood from viewing the graph. The graph makes use of de-emphasized information as well as to make sure the graph does not become 
             visually overwhelming. The second visualisation comes in the form of an annotated line graph that makes use of forecast. In the visual the data and the forecast are 
             plotted together on a single line and aren’t distinguished. Everything in the visual has been pushed to the background with the use of grey font. The visual does however
              make use of labels to five the viewer an understanding of forward looking expectations, the graph however may be easily interpretable but it does not draw the 
              viewers’ attention. The 3rd visual displayed is the 100% stacked bars graph. The stacked bar graph is often used in the consulting world designed to show progress
               against different goals. The graph ensures that the viewer is able to first understand what information is being displayed with the placement of the title above
                the graph. In the actual data the graph makes use of red as well as grey with the red being done primarily to grab the viewers’ attention and show them that
                 information first compared to the grey information.</p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>The 4th visual is the positive and negative stacked bars, most viewers’ attention will be drawn from the title to the bold black fronted numbers that follow 
             to the right, and this is done to show the viewer the unmet data or the gap, and this will then lead the viewer to look into text at the bottom as well as the 
             data that is displaced. There is a clear sign that the colour that was used in the visuals where intentionally done as seen in the use of blues being that of a 
             medium blue as well as a more saturated blue at the bottom which reinforces the idea that the lighter blue is a negative to what should be there. The last graph
              that is displayed is the horizontal stacked bars. The information displayed is gathered from a survey, it is a great way of displaying a greater amount of information 
              while not being to overwhelming for the viewer. The most important information is displayed in a much darker shade and first the rest of the information thus follows 
              this route going down in both priority position and saturation in colour to show the viewer topics considered most important to least. The categories are represented
               vertically to give the viewer a clear interpretation of the data.  </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>As can be seen in the reading, the data that is displayed as well as what type of graphs that are chosen are important and are often done with clear intent. 
             The reading also gives perspective as to how the data should then be displayed in the graph while both being informative for the viewer however not being too 
             overwhelming for the viewer either. This is done by the colours, titles, texts as well as what graph is being used for what information, graphs should always
              be tested before going out into a public area and should be viewed by multiple different people.</p>
