           <p>
            Today’s blog will be a critical reflection on the representation and communication strategies that can be viewed in my graphs.
            </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>
            I have 2 graphs in my websites as of right now. The first one is a scatter plot filled with blue dots that represent the top 20 players in Legends of Runeterra
             and represents their LP or Total league points which represents all the games that they have won and how many points they have accumulated it is how they are 
             ranked. They are ranked from 0 to 20 on the x axis and on the y axis is the LP points going from 0 to 1000. The second graph that is displayed is a bar graph
              comparing the total wins of the top 9 Challenger players (which as of right now is the highest rank one can have) and top 9 Iron players (which is the lowest rank) 
              in League of Legends. With the wins being displayed on the y axis and the names of the players being displayed on the x axis. Admittedly one of the biggest flaws 
              with both graphs that are displayed is the lack of labels, as this is something that I have no real knowledge on how it is to be done, which can be seen as an 
              oversight however there is a paragraph explaining above each graph explaining the details of the information being shown.
             </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>When designing the website with the narrative of using competitive games there was the question of the audience viewing the data according to Communicating Data
              to an audience by Riche one needs to look at how literate is the audience to the terms in the data and visualisation, how knowledgeable they are to the jargon,
               how much background knowledge and domain expertise as well as thirdly what are the audiences expectations. The website is designed to give players an idea of 
               the best of the best players in the world and is done to try and promote the idea that players can always improve and that they should be proud of every achievement
                as it is a way to understand the game and many pro players stream which allows visitors to watch them if they do as well as search their stats to further understand
                 how they play. With this in mind the websites assumes that the visitors are already established players who know what League or Legends of Runterra are so assumes
                  they are aware of what exactly the data means beforehand they should be aware or have some understanding of the games. However the website does aim to try and
                   explain this data as best as it can with prior paragraphs explaining the game as well as data shown. This all could be improved by adding better labels to 
                   the data shown as without the x and y axis labels the data is still really hard to gauge what exactly the numbers or data points are. There also needs to be 
                   some way for newer players to find data fitted for them as the data that is shown would be more appropriate for players who have already invested their time 
                   in the game.</p>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <p>The data itself as analysed from Data driven storytelling Ch2 by Riche the data displayed can be seen as taking on a more Journalistic approach to the data as 
                     the data for its current time are true events that display critical information however for this to properly work the data needs to be more in detail meaning
                      more improvements need to be done in order for the message as well as information to be understood better. Comparing the graphs I have done to the graph
                       analyses of my previous blog known as Best in Show – What’s the Best Dog Breed, According to Data?”, the data is not overwhelming however it no as detailed 
                       as the dog diagram. It does not make use of allot visuals however this keeps the graph more simple to gauge. The data itself just like the last one is not
                        memorable.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>As can been seen from the reflection allot more needs to be done with my website and graphs in order for the information to be truly understood. Improvements can and 
                    will be made as well as the additions of new graphs with different data either from the same games or entirely different games
                     depending on the API’s.</p>
