          Something I had wanted to work on, and display in my website was to display all the champions in League of Legends as well as their stats, this could be seen
           when first starting my website as that page was there but was not finished. That goal has finally been met and this blog will go over the data visualisation
            that I have created and will address the interactivity that can be seen within my data-driven artwork.

         </p>
              <br>
              <br>
        <p>
          For my data visualisation I had created a tree map chart that displays 15 different champions from League of Legends, and displays a short blurb from their lore,
           their difficulty, tags and Part type. Each tag of the tree map links to a starting point and from there the user is able to click on the links to close and open
            the links they want to keep up. Unlike with plotting two varibles in the same visual field which might confuse the user into seeing an implied relation, the tree 
            map will display the relation between different points (Riche et al., 2018). In this way they user is able to compare and view specific data as well as comparing 
            specific champions while ignoring the other champion lists. My entire website is based around Esports games as well as me displaying that that the user is able to
             get better through time and effort, however, there is no real form or display of why the users should actively trust me. Through this graph I display Background 
             Knowledge and Expertise as well as clearly displaying an interest in the games being spoken about. In terms of storytelling the data that is on display is ordered
              in a bias manner as the list follows my personal top 15 favourite champions. 
          </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
        <p>The data is not meant to be a list of the best champions as when a user comes to view the data they have their own viewpoints, experiences and backgrounds 
          (Riche et al., 2018), with this in mind my data is not designed to tell users what they should play rather it allows experienced players to compare the data
           of my champs and their champs. If the addition of all 157 League of legends champions was done then it would allow for immediate comparisons of my champions
            and theirs. For those who are new to League of Legends the tree chart allows them to analyse future champions that they might play. The data is easy to 
            understand and work with while being technical enough for those more experienced in the game to learn something new. The chart itself is flexible in the
             ways that the user can interact with it, however, the initial idea was to hopefully create a checkbox that could be used alongside the chart that would 
             have allowed the user to display specific information. I was unable to fulfil this goal unfortunately.

                  With the API and topic I have chosen there is no real room to be creative in what I make, however I felt that was away to design something unique compared
                   to the other charts done in my website.
