      <article class = "paragraph2"><p>UI and UX designs are a core component in making any successful website one that is easy for the visitors to use and pleasing enough
         for them to want to continue viewing the website as well as return to the website. My website has not fully been fleshed out however the potential look and feel 
         can be analysed based of the wireframes that have been submitted already. This blog will be critically analysing my websites UI and UX design based off the wireframes 
         as well as already done details of my website.</p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>At its current point my website contains a few pages this being the landing page, about page and contact page, however the wireframe also portrays how the data designed
              pages may appear. From the landing page the website has its information set out in a way that it is readable and the users can view all the information that is 
              available for them in the website, there are however allot of white space where there is nothing occupying the page, however the landing page does not require allot
               of information. The contact page is filled with the necessary information that being the phone number and email, it is simple and easily available for the user once
                they click on the contact tab on the navigation bar, the navigational bar on the wireframe has a small indicator placed to show the user where they are, the 
                navigation bar will lead the users to all the tabs they wish to have access to. The about page tells the viewer who we are and may display an image depending 
                on what is considered however that is subject to change. The data that is displayed should be set in such a way that the user is easily able to access what they
                 want and are able to view what exactly is being presented. In this case it being the information around the Esports tournaments that are happening allowing
                  viewers to view the specific games that they want to as well as specific statistics from those games. </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>The website is yet to be made fully however the idea of the website and how it is laid out as in the wireframes and initial beta stage of the website is very simple, 
             this is not necessarily a bad thing however as all the information available for the user is on display and easily accessible and does not over whelm the user when using
              the website however there is no real attraction to stay with the website except for  those who have an interest towards the initial idea of the website topic that
               being Esport. </p>
