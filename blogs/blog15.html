          This blog post will be a critical reflection of Data-driven storytelling Chapter 10 from Riche, N. H. et al.

          This chapter is based around the ethics of visual storytelling, expressing how little information about ethical data there really is only being about 17 results from over
           400. The goal of this chapter is based on creating a framework for ethical decisions related to data-driven visual stories. In the context of this chapter, ethics is 
           defined as the making of sound editorial decisions that work alongside the entire data-driven visual storytelling process this means from collection and acquisition 
           of the data to the analysis and presentation. There are 3 principles used by the authors to define what they deem as ethical data-driven storytelling production, 
           these are to be transparent, seek the truth and present it as fully as possible and engage with the community as an ends not as a means. Being ethical can be seen 
           as a positive outcome for the end-user as it not only creates the idea of honesty and virtuous intent but it can also minimize potential errors.

                 <br>
        <p>The chapter then proceeds to explain the importance of each ethical consideration starting from Data Acquisition. Provenance is the origin of the data that is used and 
          it is important to understand who produced the data, what is its intent is timely, accurate and complete. Quantification is how the world is measured and how it is turned 
          into data. This includes how the individual data is measured and how the world is sampled as well as how measurements are defined to begin. The next consideration is Data
           Transformation. Normalization is an issue brought up in the chapter which displays the concerns on how choices in normalization affect the insight of a story and will 
           affect how the reader comes away with it. One way to create a more ethical decision of normalization is to provide the end-user with more freedom to make this decision 
           on their terms such as with interactivity.  Aggregation data is derived through mathematical operations or combinations, to ensure ethical data it is preferred that all
            workings of the data and comparisons are visually compared. There are many other points in terms of data transformation such as Algorithmic derivation, filtering and
             Anonymization. The next consideration comes in the form of Conveying and Connecting Insight and this is met with the 4 classes these being Visual Mapping and 
             Representation, Implied Relationships, Context and Annotation and Interactivity.

                  This chapter expresses the importance of ethical data and aims to create a framework for ethical decisions, by displaying many factors that assist in creating 
                  ethical data, from Data Acquisition, Data Transformation and Conveying and Connecting insights. This chapter aims to assist data storytellers to become more
                   cognizant of their responsibility and role in guiding how data is interpreted by an audience and this should happen in the data acquisition and transformations
                    stages.
