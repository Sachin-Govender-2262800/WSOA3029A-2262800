This blog post will be done reflecting on the data representation that I have created within my Data-driven artwork within my website. 

            </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>
            To analyse my website and data-driven artworks in this case being my graphs and charts one needs to analyse it using and understanding communication and representation 
            strategies that were used, the first would be to understand the designed message. My website is based around video games mainly Esports games, there are as of writing 
            this only 3 games that have been used, League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra and Dota2. My website has been created to give stats of different players and different 
            data within these games professional as well as casual league of players. The main goal is to promote the idea that with enough practice and time someone who plays 
            these games can always improve and climb the ranks within their division and can always reach a higher goal. Even with comparing the lower ranks to the highest level
             of play with my League of Legends graph is done to give players goals and show how they could progress and what they may intern need to go through. With the last
              2 graphs it displays some of the highest level of play and shows the audience where they could be if they practiced and took the games they played more seriously.
               This goes to another level of communication strategies used that being the target audience.
             </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>The target audience would mainly be pushed towards users who mainly play games, weather that be within a more casual or serious nature. The age being a variety of 
             ages as even though League of legends is pushed towards an audience of 13 and older, Dota2 being an audience 17 and Legends of Runeterra having a rating of ages 7 
             and up, many different ages are actually introduced to one of if not all of these games through different methods. This can be applied to users to prefer watching 
             Esports and are interested in those statistics or players who again interested in those statistics but for the reasons of wanting to reach that. The data thus 
             provided in my graphs is simple enough that anyone who has a casual interest in those statistics can easily understand what and how the data is being compared 
             while data itself will intrigue and audience that in some way has an interest to any one of the games used. This further goes into the user experience, 
             nothing is hidden the data is easy to read and with the third graph there is a small interaction within the graph that allows the user to hide the data that 
             doesnâ€™t interest them this is done to allow the users to compare the data of 2 or more specific teams. Another understanding of communication strategies is 
             that of the media platform that the data is displayed on. The website is designed to be viewed on a computer, laptop or mobile device as the data is always 
             changing as these type of stats are very susceptible to change and this is the easiest way to reach the target audience as they are most likely always online.</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>My website has been designed to display data around different Esports games and makes use of charts and graphs in order to display the important data 
                     that is needed and can be seen using the different communication strategies as displayed within this blog.
