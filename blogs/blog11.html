            This blog will be a close reading and reflection on the journal known as “What is interaction for Data Visualization by Dimara and Perin.

            </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>
            Within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the concept of interaction has been a challenging concept to define, however, due to a recent review known as 
            “What is interaction?” interactivity within this field has been summarized. In terms of visualization, however, these concepts do not relate as clearly as they should.
             There has been a growing desire for the interaction within visualization to provide the user with absolute freedom and create a more enriching experience, 
             having absolute control to personalize, sketch, author and restructure the visualizations. Interaction is something that occurs at all stages of the process 
             of visualization from turning raw data into views on the data, however, there is no real definition of what interactivity means within the visualization. 
             Dimara and Perin thus address this by viewing interactivity based on what was seen within the visualization community as well as reviewing it from the 
             perspective of the HCI community.
             </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>3 requirements had to be met when coming up with the definition, 1 the view of interaction could not be captured only by citation numbers rather it needed to include 
             expert input, there could not only be the snowballing approach used as this was seen as biased by the selection group and lastly it must not include HCI papers that
              were unrelated to visualization. There were specific methods used in collecting a list of seed papers, step 1 had them starting from their list of 5 definition papers, 
              step2 had them sending out the questionnaires to expert visualization researchers, step 3 they had compiled their work into a journal article or conference paper to be
               reviewed and step 4 had them repeating step 2 sending it to different authors, this was all stopped when there was no more new seed papers or authors found. They found 
               that the definitions for interactivity with visualization has been an overloaded and elusive term and was considered challenging to find. Therefore they had considered
                a further 32 papers to identify a definition of interaction whether implicitly or explicitly.</p>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <p>Interaction for visualization is seen as a goal-orientated activity that is sequential, incremental, contains semantics, is iterative and has the following
                      properties. It is Granularity, CONTINUOUS vs Discrete and Direct vs Indirect. In summary of the visualization view of Interactivity, it is conceptualized as
                       a dialogue between the human user and the visualization system around a specific point of interest that is data. To make this dialogue successful it demands
                        systems be flexible enough to accommodate broader user intents. The HCI view of interaction however is something at this point that still needs to be answered
                         as there is a lack of definition of interaction for it. 7 concepts characterize interaction in HCI namely Dialogue, Transmission, Control, Tool use, Optimal
                          behaviour, Embodiment and Experience. When HCI comes into terms it can be seen to extend the view of interaction in visualization as HCI extends the scope
                           of User Intent, User profiling and what good interaction is.

                  <p>
                    Interactivity in visualization as a whole can be seen as a broad term that has no real set definition. Dimara and Perin aimed to provide a definition that they 
                    deemed fit based on multiple papers and definitions.
