      <article class = "paragraph1"><p>YouTube is one of the largest websites on the internet, with many users that make use of it every day, one of these users that make use of
         it every day is me. YouTube is filled with millions of videos and can keep many users distracted for hours at a time.  This blog will be discussing the UX and UI design of 
         YouTube’s homepage on the pc.</p>
           <br>
           <br>
           <p>First is the understanding of what is UX and UI, UX refers to User experience which is described as all the aspects of the end users interaction with a company’s 
             service and or product whether the experience is intuitive and smooth or clunky and confusing, whereas UI stands for User Interface design which can be seen as a
              completely digital interaction between the user and the digital device or product this can be seen as the graphical layout of the application or product. Both of 
              these are crucial for a website and work closely together however both are quite different (LAMPRECHT, 2021). Now how does YouTube make use of UX and UI this analysis 
              will be based around YouTube’s Homepage. There is a difference between a new users making use of YouTube compared to that of someone who has had a YouTube account
               for multiple years. For someone who has just created a YouTube account they would be faced with a somewhat empty page however YouTube would try to display videos
                that are popular around their age group or geographic as YouTube is linked to Google there would be allot of Data available for them to have access to. An older
                 members YouTube would be filled with videos that they would be interested in based of past search histories, channels they are subscribed to as well as google
                  data.</p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>In this way a returning YouTube viewer would have a much better UX compared to a relatively new user or someone who does not use YouTube frequently. YouTube’s
              home page does make it easy for users to navigate around the website having the search bar right at the centre as well as recommended categories to limit the
               video search right underneath or filter tabs, the bar on the left side of the YouTube site has categories that the user might want to have access to such as 
               looking at their subscriptions, history, liked videos and more. However the YouTube Website is not perfect an interview done by Adamnizri showed that users feel 
               overloaded as the enter the home page, they do not understand the YouTube features, they do not make use of the filter tabs and that they like to see the videos 
               they recently watched (Adamnizri, 2020).</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>YouTube can always improve upon the UX and UI design the biggest issue for YouTube’s lack of improvement when it comes to their website is due to the lack of any real
              competition YouTube is one of the only sites that gives users the option to watch millions of videos on a variety of topics based on their interests however this
               should not be an excuse for the lack of improvement and should rather be a large factor on YouTube’s continual growth as a website.  </p>
