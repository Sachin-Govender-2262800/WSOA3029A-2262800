            This essay will be analysing Sabine Roeser work known as “How art can contribute to ethical reflection on risky technologies”.
             Roeser’s essay speaks about and examines how art can be used to engage with risky technologies such as being techno-art and how 
             art can make problems more concrete and help aid with solving these issues.

As artists try to create new and exciting works they may often times experiment with the addition of new methods or ways of how art is created. 
Such can be seen with techno-art as artists begin exploring the possibilities of adding technology into their work, this however is seen as controversial 
and risky. Many artists and writers in the past had a split view towards technology and science some took a critical stance towards them such as with Dystopian 
novels such as a Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Whereas other artists had embraced technology such as Leonado da Vinci, 
there have also been movements that embraced technology and science such as with De Stijl, Futurism and Constructivism. There are a much more artists and
 writers now who engage with technology, embracing it rather than rejecting it as was prevalent in the past. There are new genres of literacy that have
  been devoted to environmental issues even having specialised academic journals dedicated towards these issues. There are also an increased number of
   visual artists who incorporated different technologies into their work as these technologies create new material possibilities as well as creating
    a whole new topics. This can be seen with William Verstraeten a nuclear artist and David Buckland a climate artist. With incorporation of techno-art
     comes the idea of bio-art, robotics-art as well as ICT-art. With this type of work artists such as Stelarc explore the possibility of stem cell research
      and enhancements that can go beyond the way that scientist may usually approach such developments. This type of work explores conceptual and normative
       issues such as the meaning of connectedness in an age of hyper connectivity.

                    <br>
           <p>When it comes to techno-art one must also consider emotional-moral reflections about the risks of it. Techno-artists are able to impact on society in a more tangible way and with a larger
              audience than what scientific articles could reach. They are able to create awareness of societal issues and can provide for critical reflection on technological 
              as well as scientifically developments. There are however risks with techno-art and many questions that arise from this forms of art such as what are the technological
               risks that are being addressed in the artwork, what moral values are exemplified or used within the art works and how does the artwork highlight these values. 
               These works also give rise to an emotional response and this emotional response may play a role with the ethical reflection that is triggered by the works of
                techno-art. With the creation of new technologies and probe emotional moral reflection it provides us with new experiences. </p>

                   <p>There are many different views on techno-art and many risks involved as well, techno-art can play a crucial role in creating sustainable energy 
                     technologies and can assist in helping combat climate issues. There are many potentially constructive contributions that techno-art could make, 
                     it helps people make abstract problems more concrete, allows for the exploration of new scenarios and can broaden someone’s perspective through 
                     sympathy, empathy and compassion. Techno-art is a rapidly developing field that needs to be further explored and researched by artist, writers 
                     and scientist.
