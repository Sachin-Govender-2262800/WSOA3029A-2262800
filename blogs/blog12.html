           <p>
            This blog aims to discuss the role that interactivity plays in acting as a semiotic device by analysing a specific case study from the website “Information is Beautiful.” 

            </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>
            To understand the case study one must first understand what exactly a semiotic device is as well as interactivity in terms of visualization. Semiotics can be understood
             as the study of signs and symbols mainly as an element of communication and language (Nordquist, 2020). Interactivity is something that Dimara and Perin had seen as 
             something that is a goal-orientated activity and is seen as the dialogue between the user and the visualization system that is based around a common interest point 
             or data, to ensure this dialogue is successful the visualization needs to ensure it is flexible enough to accommodate the users broader intents.
             </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>The case I have decided to use is known as “Based on a True True Story? Scene-by-scene Breakdown of Hollywood Films,” and can be viewed at
              <a href = "https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/">https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/</a>. This visualisation can be understood as a timeline that follows movies based on true 
              stories and compares them to those actual true stories, there are as of writing this blog 18 movies that are compared. The timeline is broken further in 5 categories 
              that being TRUE, TRUE-ISH, FALSE-ISH, FALSE and UNKNOWN. The user is able to view the timeline by seeing these colours when a user clicks on the specific colour or 
              the timeline itself they are able to view the time in the movie, a brief explanation of the specific scene of the movie, what cater gory it is considered and a brief 
              explanation of what actually happened. The information can be further filtered to be more factual on the information that is actually true meaning there is less and
               less leniency for what is considered as truth or the user can ask for the data to be flexible with the truth. It can also be sorted by the date the movies where
                released, users are also able to suggest new movies as well as sign up to get notification of changes.</p>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <p>In this way the interactivity in terms of semiotic devices the signs and symbols that are used comes in terms of the colours as well as the interactive blocks 
                     that can be viewed on the timeline. The blocks will display specific or important scenes in the movie that when clicked on gives the viewer even more information
                      and these blocks themselves are coloured which just with that in mind the user would be able to understand whether that block is true or not. Just with these 
                      simple forms of semiotics the user is able to understand specific information from the data without even needed to go into full detail. Here it shows how 
                      interactivity can work to reduce how much information needs to be portrayed by the website and allows the designers to implement as much information and 
                      visualization as they want without the website becoming too overwhelming.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    The data being portrayed by the website also displays how Interactivity can be used as a semiotic device to simplifying the data in such a way that it is possible
                     for the user to understand the message that the website is trying to portray at a moment’s glance.
                    </p>
