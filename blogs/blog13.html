           <p>
            This blog will discuss the representation and communication strategies based on how I used interactivity in my Data-Visualization.

            </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
           <p>
            My website has only one interactive chart being for the DOTA 2 data, the chart I have created is a bar graph that displays 10 professional teams and displays the pro 
            league wins of each team. The interactivity comes in the form of clickable checkboxes on the side that allow the user to check and uncheck specific teams that they
             want to see allowing them to view what exactly they want when comparing the teams. The main reason for interactive data as explained by Murray is to empower the user
              to explore the data for themselves, and that is exactly what I wanted the user to do when looking into my data visualisation (2017). One of the strategies that
               were used in my data visualisation was to ensure the communication method, as well as the information being provided, was not complex for the user to understand.
                The graph is very simple to understand and stands out from the background, the checkboxes are placed at the side of the graph with ticks displaying which bars 
                are visible and will go white when they aren’t visible which contrasts from the black background. The names of the teams are displayed at the bottom of the bars 
                as well as next to the checkboxes. The number of wins is displayed on top of the bars so the user is able to view it without any hassle. It could however have
                 been made easier if there was a side axis displaying the numbers.
             </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
           <p>In terms of engaging with my audience, the website is designed for users who are interested in video games and Esports. The graph contains data of 10 popular 
             professional DOTA 2 teams meaning if they are viewing the data they are already interested in DOTA 2 and there is a likely chance that the team that they 
             support is on display, meaning the user may have a bias towards the data that is on display. In terms of keeping the user engaged when viewing the graph 
             is contrasting the background meaning the data does pop out for the viewer and they are able to specify which teams exactly they want to compare. 
              The data as well as the website as a whole tells a story that of showing how teams and players can always improve and that there is always another 
              goal to reach, as the entire goal of the website is to display data of teams and players in order to show them where they could be if they practised 
              and worked hard into achieving their goals to become professional or just better players. These strategies can be seen from NEDIGER (2020).</p>

                   <p>
                    These are the strategies that can be viewed within my website as it is designed around video games and Esports. There could however be allot more done in 
                    terms of actual interaction between the user and website.
