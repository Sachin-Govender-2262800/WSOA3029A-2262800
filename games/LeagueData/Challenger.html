  <section class = "paragraph1"><p> The goal of this graph is too compare the heighest Iron players which is the lowest rank in League with the highest players in Challenger which is 
    the highest rank a player can achive at the moment. This is not done to mock or praise specfic players rather to display the skill gap in terms of wins. One needs to always remember
    that the pros of League and highest players started somewhere. They were all at the same point and with enough practice and determination you too can reach where they are. That decsion however
    is up to you and that depends on how much time you want to spend on League. Remember any improvemnt is good. The Y axis displays the wins of the players and the X axis is the names of the players.
    The graph is in decending order however the highest numbers above 200 are the Challenger players or the first 9 players. The last 9 or the ones below 100 are the Iron players.
