       <section class = "paragraph1"><p> League of Legends is a game filled with champions, as of writing this there are 157 champions. This is  a list of champions in league 
           put into a tree diagram that displaying some of their stats. Due to me being new at coding however I have decided to display just 15 champions as coding in 157 would be possibly
           just extremley long as well as the fact that the tree diagram would look more confusing. This sets me up to create multiple tree diagrams with the champions, as of right now
           I have dispalyed 15 of my favorite champions in League of Legnds. I feel as if I have not really shown any of my intrests in any of the charts I have made, so i decided to 
           move away from Esports and ranks rather displaying some champions I like. This list however can be a good point to show you guys which champ you might want to play based of the
           stats provided in the tree chart. The chart displays the champions, difficulty, Tags, a PartType and a short blurb from the characters lore. The data was extracted from
           <a href = "http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/data/en_US/champion.json">http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/6.24.1/data/en_US/champion.json</a>. Some of 
           you might be wondering why the champions are not in alphabetical order, that is because I have displayed the champions in order of my favorties, starting from Jhin and ending at
           Morgana. If unfortunately you are unable to view my data follow <a href ="/WSOA3029A-2262800/games/LeagueData/whatshouldbeseen.html">This link</a>to view what it should look like.
