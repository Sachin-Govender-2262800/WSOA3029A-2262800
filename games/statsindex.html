 <section class = "paragraph1"><p>Here is a page with the details of the games I have data off. Click one of the links to go to the specified topics and view the data within, However I would
   like to explain a few things before you view the data.
 </p>
 <br>
 <br>
<p>The data as of right now has been aquired from Riots Api for the League of Legneds data as well as Legends of Runeterra accessible here <a href ="https://developer.riotgames.com/">https://developer.riotgames.com/</a> 
However all the data has been taken and been turned into Json data using the postman application that can be viewed here <a href ="https://www.postman.com/">https://www.postman.com/</a>. The Json data has then been stored
in the website itself and then specfic data has been used in the creation of the graphs. An API would have been better ,however, This has been done as The Riot Api itself has very strict security where you have to reregister you API key
and the data will always appear with an error stating that the data has not been approved with CORS terms meaning To display what I would want too I would have reupdate my website every 24 hours with 
a new API key  </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The reason that specfic data is thus used is because of the fact that even if I do use the API and update the key every 24 hours the way the Riot API is set I would have to dispaly all the data
  not specfied data such as using only the top 10 results or lowest as the Riot API does no allow for that, I have tried multiple methods all without success, this was the only way it could be done.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> I have only stuck with Riot games as of now as just getting the Riot games data was hard enough and after viewing the data for Dota 2 and CS:GO it can be viewed as being just as hard 
    to work with if not harder than Riot Games API. With this information in mine please view what you want too.
