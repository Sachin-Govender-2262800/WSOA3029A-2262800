  <section class = "paragraph1">Everyone understands that Esports is a form of competition between 2 or more teams and/or players, that is played using a digital device.
     Just because it is digital does not take away from the enjoyment that is the Esports leagues. Just like a stadium for sports teams, 
     there are arenas filled with fans showing their support for their Esports teams.

     Due to Covid, there have been numerous restrictions that have affected events like this. Esports however does have the luxury of being streamed and playing online,
      something live sports games cannot do. There is however a community of fans who love to watch their favourite teams and players live, I know this chart is something 
      different from the charts that have been done on my website especially about games. I however feel this is an important graph to display as it may allow for users to 
      understand the likely hood of another live Esports game being done in the future.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
  Unfortunately or I guess depending on how you look 
 at it due to the lower number of cases within the 
Australia-Oceania and African Continents the number of Active cases is harder to view.
 This is why I have thus decided to provide the numbers as well as the pie chart below.<p> </p>
