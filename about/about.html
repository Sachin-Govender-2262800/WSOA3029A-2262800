      <article class = "paragraph1"><p>Hi My name is Sachin Govender! This is my website dedicated to showing Data from diffrent games. Mainly competitive games such as League of Legends
        ,Legends of Runeterra, Dota 2 and many more. Right now the website is very limited with the information that is provided. There is a reason for that but that will be explained later on a diffrent page <a href = "../games/statsindex.html">click here to jump to the reasoning</a>. 
      I would first like to discuss the reason as to why I choose to discuss this specfic website and the narrative I would like to create around it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>My main inspiration for even wanting to go into this topic is my love and intrest for video games, in more recent times those video games have moved to such games as League of Legneds and Legends
  of Runeterra. Both being highly competitive games that require the player to make time to learn diffrent mechanics and think about every decision more logically. Throughout my time of playing both 
  I have remained as someone who tries to play it for fun. However even with this mentality I have witnessed my own growth as player and this has always been because of the effort and intrest I
  have put into these games. The improvements have always come from watching Youtube videos, Watching the Pros and researching their data as well as understanding the diffrences between my level of play
  compared to theirs. The reason for this website is the idea to create a platform for viewers to view this data in one place to try and create a platform one can better understand the game
  that may potentially lead to their own self improvemnt in the game such as my own.
</p>
<br>
<br>
        <p>The website as of right now has diffrent forms of visual data that display diffrent levels of mastery, In terms of how succesful other players are in the specfic games they are playing
          This website is not aimed to mock or praise players, rather the idea of this website is to create a space where visitors who are intrested in the specfic game they are viewing can compare
          those who are at a higher level to themselves. The main goal is to try and create the idea of improvement to show players where they could be if they palyed and that there always is room 
          for improvment, However this narrative remains in that idea that the players at the highest level either play these games professinally or have more time to play and dedicate their time to 
          the specfic game that they are playing. This doesn't mean visitors need to stop everything to play these games rather appreciate your growth as both a player and person, we've provided this data
          in the hopes that you will aim to improve.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> As of right now the data is limited to League of Legends and Legends of Runeterra as those are my favorite games, but I hope to branch out into diffrent games such as Dota 2, CS:GO and many more
          competitive games.
